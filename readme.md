# Manhattan Project for AI

The **Manhattan Project for AI** aims to create a groundbreaking, fully autonomous AI model and system that combines classical neural networks (e.g., CNNs, RNNs), quantum-inspired algorithms, and bio-inspired paradigms such as spiking neural networks (SNNs). The project focuses on local hardware execution, automated code generation, efficiency, and scalability.

## Features

- **Novel Architecture Design**: Combines classical, quantum-inspired, and bio-inspired approaches.
- **Local Hardware Execution**: Optimized to run and train entirely on local hardware.
- **Automated Code Generation**: Recursive self-improvement through meta-programming, genetic programming, and reinforcement learning.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/manhattan_project_for_ai.git
